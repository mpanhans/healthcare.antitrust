## Resubmission
This is a second re-submission. In this version I have:

* Changed the URL in wtp_calc.Rd to be \doi{} with the DOI only


## Past Resubmission
In the first resubmission, I have:

* Removed "Tools for" from the start of the title and description.

* Changed to using the Authors@R field to declare Maintainer and Authors

* Added return values to functions cell_defn.Rd, div_calc.Rd, wtp_calc.Rd

* Added an example for each function: cell_defn, div_calc, and wtp_calc

* Removed the use of print() from cell_defn.R and div_calc.R


## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.1.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs 
(Except for 1 NOTE that appears to be for new submission.)

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package
