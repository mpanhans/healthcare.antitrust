The goal of healthcare.antitrust is to provide a set of tools commonly used in the antitrust analysis of healthcare markets. The main functions of the package can be used to implement the semiparametric estimation technique described in Raval, Rosenbaum, and Tenn (2017) "A Semiparametric Discrete Choice Model: An Application to Hospital Mergers."

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->
<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. -->
<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->
<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub! -->
